MonoRFS
Visual SLAM system using Random Finite Sets

Author:  Angelo Falchetti
Version: 0.3

This is a simple program that implements a Rao-Blackwellized PHD filter for
autonomous navigation in 3D space. It consists of several components:

* A SLAM solver unit, which is the responsible of handling the Bayes updates
  over the map and pose state of a vehicle.
  
* A simulator, which gives live feedback to the user about the state of the
  system and allows him to control the autonomous device.
  
* A viewer, that can reproduce previously recorded runs of the simulator, to
  present to others or for fine-grain analysis.
  
* A device interface, which can talk to a RGBD camera and process its output
  images (both color and depth) and generate the necessary data for the SLAM
  solver to work on.
  
* A device faker unit, which takes PNG streams and creates oni files suitable as
  input to the device interface, allowing video reuse and easy reproducibility.
  
* A post-processing script that generates useful plots about the simulated run.

* An alternative SLAM solver, which uses the iSAM2 algorithm to estimate the
  world state. It uses the gtsam library.

--- Sample uses ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Start analyzing a live RGBD stream with assumed odometry "movroom.in",
# 200 particles and solving both mapping and localization
monorfs -c=movroom.in -p=200

# Start analyzing a recorded RGBD stream from file "room.oni" with assumed
# odometry "movroom.in", 40 particles and perfect localization
monorfs -f=room.oni -c=movroom.in -p=40 -y

# Start a new simulation with a world description given in file "map.world",
# movement commands in "moves.in" (odometry), with 20 particles and
# assuming perfect localization (at startup, this can be changed later)
monorfs -s -f=map.world -c=movements.in -p=20 -y

# Similar to above but use isam2 SLAM algorithm
monorfs -s -f=map.world -c=movements.in -a=isam2

# The same as the above, but in headless mode
monorfs -s -f=map.world -c=movements.in -a=isam2 -x

# Open a previous run with a Viewer
monorfs -v -f=map.world
